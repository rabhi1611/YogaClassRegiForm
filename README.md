   # -> Yoga Class Registration Form Web Application
   
   1) This application is based on Django Backend Web development framework.
   
   2) It basically uses sqlite database for saving data.
   
   3) It does some basic validations and if it's all right then, it saves the data to the database. 
   
   4) My approach was that I have created two html templates for index page and success page.
   
   5) Then I route those template to a specific url by writing my logic to the views.py file.

   6) For creating form, i have used django ModelForm package which basically creates form with the help of columns of the table.
   
   7) I have used Student table for creating ModelForm in forms.py file itself. 

   8) If all the details of the user is verified by the backend then, after pressing pay fees button, the server will redirect you to a success page which means form gets       successfully submitted. Otherwise, it will highlight errors.
